Automated enforcement data viz for city of Chicago

Until the replicable data pull can be coded in, a crude view of the map is available in the auto_enforce_graphs.pdf. Next steps are to set up an API pull for the Chicago Data Portal to pull in both the speed and red light camera data. Currently that data lives and is being queried through a local sqlite database.
